If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
I used some youtube videos in order to teach myself how to make a website, this is the main video that helped me: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndEFbDOsM6c&ab_channel=HurrayBanana
What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
A challenge I faced while creating was the design phase. There were endless way I could have done this, but I chose to use javascript, html, and css in order to build this and also designed functions to help create the logic in my code. I also ran into many bugs like not getting the pattern to work which took me a while but with my debugging skills, I was able to figure out all of my bugs. 
What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
My questions about web development after completeing this game is, how complex of a game can we create on a website? This game doesn't require much data or crazy graphics card, but I was just wondering what are the possiblities of games on websites. I know microsoft uses cloud to stream games online and play them on almost anything, but they have a input delay, so I am very curious aobut the possiblities.
If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
I would spend more time making the game look good and adding sound effects because this will add a woah factor to my game. I wasn't able to implement sound purely because this was my first time ever even making a website, so just getting this far with a little amount of time is a big achievement for me.
